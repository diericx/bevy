# iceetime

Iceetime is a self hosted, isolated alternative to Popcorntime that aims to follow torrent ethos and be private tracker friendly. 

You host an instance of iceetime on your server, and can then stream content from it to any device. 
The server is the only device that needs a VPN as it's the only one torrenting. 

## Current state 

This project can currently download a torrent sequentially and serve that stream to a browser via Gos built in servecontent function.
